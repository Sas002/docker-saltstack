# Saltstack Docker Container

This is my effort to run Salt masters in Docker containers.

## Features

* Automated builds
* Available as Alpine or Ubuntu
* TLS for API enabled by default (self-signed cert generated if no cert found)

### Why not saltstack/docker-containers

* The images on the official [SaltStack repo](https://github.com/saltstack/docker-containers) are not well maintained.
* There new and better ways manage service(s) within a container, i.e. [tini](https://github.com/krallin/tini).
* The base images, w/o SaltStack, are separated into their own [repo](https://github.com/digitalr00ts/docker-saltstack-base).

## Todos

* Better testing
* Run salt service as not root
* Move
  * `/etc/salt/master.d` to `/opt/salt/master.d`
  * `/etc/salt/pki/` to `/opt/salt/pki/`
* Add volumes to docker-compose
* docker-compose for Alpine
* Merge dev to master if test pass
* Move docker hub to watch master
