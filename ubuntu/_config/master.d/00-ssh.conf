#####     Salt-SSH Configuration     #####
##########################################

# Pass in an alternative location for the salt-ssh roster file
#roster_file: /etc/salt/roster

# Define locations for roster files so they can be chosen when using Salt API.
# An administrator can place roster files into these locations. Then when
# calling Salt API, parameter 'roster_file' should contain a relative path to
# these locations. That is, "roster_file=/foo/roster" will be resolved as
# "/etc/salt/roster.d/foo/roster" etc. This feature prevents passing insecure
# custom rosters through the Salt API.
#
#rosters:
# - /etc/salt/roster.d
# - /opt/salt/some/more/rosters

# The log file of the salt-ssh command:
# ssh_log_file: /var/log/salt/ssh

# Pass in minion option overrides that will be inserted into the SHIM for
# salt-ssh calls. The local minion config is not used for salt-ssh. Can be
# overridden on a per-minion basis in the roster (`minion_opts`)
#ssh_minion_opts:
#  gpg_keydir: /root/gpg

# Set this to True to default to using ~/.ssh/id_rsa for salt-ssh
# authentication with minions
#ssh_use_home_key: False
